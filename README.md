# Cors::Ui

## Overview
Cors::Ui is a Rails Engine that provides a web interface for inspecting and testing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configurations in your Rails application.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "cors-ui"
```

Then execute:

```bash
bundle install
```

Or install it manually:

```bash
gem install cors-ui
```

## Integration
After installation, mount the engine in your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
mount Cors::Ui::Engine, at: "/cors"
```

This will make the CORS UI accessible at `/cors` in your application.

## Usage
Once the engine is mounted, you can access the UI to configure CORS settings visually. The interface allows you to:

- Visualize CORS configurations across your application
- Inspect CORS settings for different routes
- View default CORS headers and configurations
- Easy integration with Rails applications
